    <p>The lyrics server accepts and distributes JSON lyric objects in the format:</p>
    <blockquote><code>
{ title:  '',
  author: '',
  chorus: '',
  verse:  []
}
    </code></blockquote>
    <p>The 'title' attribute is required, and at least one of 
      'chorus' or 'verse' must be present. <br>
      The 'verse' attribute, if supplied, consists of an array of strings. <br>
      If 'author' is not supplied, it defaults to 'Anonymous'.</p>
    <p>To contribute a lyric, POST the JSON data as described above to
      <code>/api/lyrics/[title]</code>
      where [title] is the same string as the 'title' attribute being posted.</p>
    <p>To request a lyric, GET from 
      <code>/api/lyrics/[title]</code>
      where [title] is the 'title' attribute of the lyric being requested.</p>
    <p>To request a list of known titles, GET from
      <code>/api/lyrics</code>.
      The list of titles is supplied as a JSON array in the format:
      <code>[{ title: '', author: '' }, ... ]</code>.</p>
    <p>To correct an error in an existing lyric, PUT a corrected lyric object to 
      <code>/api/lyrics/[title]</code>
      where [title] indicates the lyric to be corrected.  If the supplied lyric
      object contains the 'title' attribute, it must match the title being corrected.</p>
